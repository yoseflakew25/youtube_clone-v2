# YouTube Clone

This is a YouTube clone web application built using React. It mimics the core functionality of the popular video-sharing platform, allowing users to search for and watch videos, as well as interact with the user interface.

## Features

- **Video Search**: Users can search for videos by entering keywords in the search bar. The application fetches relevant videos from the YouTube Data API and displays them in the search results.

- **Video Playback**: When a user selects a video from the search results, the video player component plays the selected video. Users can control the playback, including play, pause, seek, and volume adjustment.

- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive and optimized for different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices.
